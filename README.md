# Arbitrum Tutorials

This monorepo will help you get started with building on Arbitrum. It provides various simple demos showing and explaining how to interact with Arbitrum â€” deploying and using contracts directly on L2, moving Ether and tokens betweens L1 and L2, and more.

We show how you can use broadly supported Ethereum ecosystem tooling (Hardhat, Ethers-js, etc.) as well as our special [arb-ts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-ts) library for convenience.

## Installation

From root directory:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Note: Updated to just include details related to token deposits and withdrawals

To run POC demo navigate to `packages/token-deposit-withdrawal`
Ensure that environment variables are properly set in the package (especially the wallet settings and infura API endpoints).

The testnet used is Rinkeby, therefore a test wallet will need to be created and populated with test ETH.  
A connection will need to be made to the RinkArby testnet as well.  You can learn more via the following link: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/public_testnet.
